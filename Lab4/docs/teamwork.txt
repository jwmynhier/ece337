	Dwezil and I went over the design specs and 
made paper drafts of the prelab RTL designs and pseudo
code. Dwezil really took the lead on the timing
control module, because he was better at thinking
about the problem in hardware logic rather than software
logic.

3.
	We met once for a few hours. We messaged 
eachother a few times leading up to the meeting,
but we were able to finish everything we wanted to 
get done in our one meeting.

4.
	I helped to unpack the design specs. Having
read the lab document in detail befor the meeting, I
helped to get us up and running on the signals and
control flow of the problem.

5.
	Dwezil really helped me understand how we need
to think of timing control in a hardware context and
where that would differ froma  sequential software
approach.

6.
	I worked on the test bench on my own.
