2. 
	Dwezil and I checked over eachothers state
transition diagrams and asked eachother questions
about some of the timing constraints and signal
asserstion/deassertion requirements for the lab.

3.
	We worked next to each other in open lab and
asked eachother questions as issues came up.

4.
	I helped find some of the details about
signal requirements that we needed to fulfill in the
manual.

5.
	Dwezil showed me a more robust configuration
for the state transitiond diagram that helped me improve
mine.

6.
	Weston Spalding's test bench helped me realize that
I was asserting the one_k_samples flag on the 1001st sample 
instead of the 1000th.
