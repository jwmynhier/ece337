Lab5 Postlab Questions

ECE 337
Section 4

10.1:
	Q What  is  the  minimum  amount  of  time  that  data_ready
	  must  remain  asserted  to ensure  correct  operation?  

	A 2

	Q What  is  the  minimum  amount  of  time,  in  clock  cycles,
	  that  data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted in 
	  order to ensure correct operation? (You may assume that all 
	  setup and hold times, as well as any propagation delays, are 
	  negligible.) 

	A 2 full clock cycles after the first rising clock edge that
	  follows the assertion of data_ready


10.2

	Q How are the image files different? Does this make sense given
	  the filter design built in the lab? Why or why not?

	A The large areas of similar color have all turned very dark and
	  the smaller regions of the same color, like the electrical dis-
	  charges remain relatively the same. This makes sense since, with
	  four data bytes that are the same, the results will tend towards 
	  0 if the set of coefficients are similar to eachother. (F0 ~= F3, 
	  F1 ~= F2).

	Q What is the general syntax for each of the file IO functions 
	  used in the provided test bench (tb_fir_filter_image.sv)?
	A * int file_handle = $fopen(file_name, "file_format_specifiers");
	  * int warning_code = $fscanf(file_handle, "format_specifier", dest_var);
